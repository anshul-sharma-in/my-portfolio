        <p className='text-xl mt-20'>Greetings! I'm Anshul Sharma, a versatile full-stack engineer with a passion for transforming ideas into impactful digital solutions.</p>
        
        <br />
        
        <p className='text-xl'>Hailing from the historic city of Gwalior, my journey into the world of technology began with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. After gaining valuable experience in the mechanical industry, I discovered my passion for coding and enrolled in CDAC to further my skills.</p>
        
        <br />
        
        <p className='text-xl'>With dedication and perseverance, I passed through CDAC with flying colors, honing my skills in various technologies and undertaking ambitious projects, including the creation of the UrbanTicket multiplex management system.</p>
        
        <br />

        <p className='text-xl'>With over three years of professional experience under my belt, I've cultivated expertise in Java, Vue.js, and .NET technologies. My journey has been marked by continuous learning and growth, with a particular focus on frontend development using Vue.js and backend development with .NET.</p>
        
        <br />

        <p className='text-xl'>In addition to my professional endeavors, I'm also deeply involved in community initiatives and volunteer work. I believe in giving back to society and leveraging technology for positive change. Outside of work, you might find me on the cricket field, leading my team as captain in the organization's cricket tournaments.</p>
        <br />

        <p className='text-xl'>I thrive in dynamic environments where creativity, collaboration, and innovation intersect.
